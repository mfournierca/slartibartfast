Slartibartfast
===

This is a simple, whitespace heavy template for Jekyll. It draws inspiration and some components from [holman/left](https://github.com/holman/left) and [maciakl/Sample-Jekyll-Site](https://github.com/maciakl/Sample-Jekyll-Site). However, Slartibartfast has been heavily modified and does not resemble either.
